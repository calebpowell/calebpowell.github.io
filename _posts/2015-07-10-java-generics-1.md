title: Making Sense of Java Generics Pt. 1
---

Java Generics have been around for awhile now. Anyone programming in Java on a regular basis should be comfortable with how they work. Except, sometimes they can be a little tricky. Can''t they? This post attempts to give you a better mental model of generics in Java by explaining the basics around Generics and _why_ they sometimes seem a little weird (or simply don''t want to work for you). Most of the information in this post is based on the following resources (you should check them out for a deeper understanding of the material discussed here):

* [Maurice Naftalin & Philip Wadler, Java Generics and Collections (California: O''Reilly Media, 2007) Java Generics and Collections](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527754 "Java Generics and Collections")
* [Gilad Bracha, Lesson: Generics](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/index.html "Lesson: Generics")
